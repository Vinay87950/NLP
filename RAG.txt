Retriveal Augmentation Generation----
is an architecture used to help LLM model gpt4, gemini, Gemma to
provide a better response by using relevant inforgramtion from additonals source

RAG architecture---
 1- ingestion - means input of data
 2- Retriveal obtainig the knowledge from data 
 3- Generation

RAG pipleine 
ingestion consist - we have documents,convert into chunks,
        convert into embedding, doing indexing and saving into database

Retriveal - make a query, fetch the result from database, obtain result 
synthesis - combine our data, fetching from knowledge base,
        pass through LLM, along with given prompt to get response

INGESTION PART -
documents means your data like csv, json etc

chunking ??
split the data into chunks 
from chunks we get tokens 

how to figure out chunk size ?
based on different type of datasets 

embedding
1- frequency based 
BOW, IF_IDF

2- nueral nueral
Word2vec , fast text, bert etc

Vector indexing-
